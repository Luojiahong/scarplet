# scarplet

A Python package for template matching to detect fault scarps and other
landforms in digital elevation data.

It was designed with two main goals:
    - Allow contributors to easily extend the method to other landforms by defining their own template functions
    - Make it straightforward to deploy matching tasks in parallel using [dask]() or other tools

**Signal-to-noise ratio of scarp-like landforms.** a) Swath of elevation data along the northern San Andreas Fault, CA, USA, b) Mapping from the USGS Quaternary faults and folds database, c) Successful and unsuccessful detections by the scarplet methodology.

## Features

## Getting started

### Installation

`scarplet` can be installed with PyPI.

```
pip install scarplet
```

### Examples

#### Detecting fault scarps

```python
import numpy as np
import scarplet as sl
from scarplet.WindowedTemplate import Scarp

params = {'scale': 100,
          'age': 10,
          'ang_min': -10 * np.pi / 2,
          'ang_max': 10 * np.pi / 2
         }

data = sl.load('data/faultzone.tif')
res = sl.match(data, Scarp, **params)

sl.plot_results(data, res)
```

#### Extracting confined river channels

```python
import numpy as np
import scarplet as sl
from scarplet.WindowedTemplate import Channel 

params = {'scale': 10,
          'age': 10,
          'ang_min': -np.pi / 2,
          'ang_max': np.pi / 2
         }

data = sl.load('data/channelnetwork.tif')
res = sl.match(data, Channel, **params)

sl.plot_results(data, res)
```
