# scarplet

A Python package for applying template matching to digital elevation data, in
particular for detecting and measuring the maturity of fault scarps and other
landforms.

It was designed with two main goals:

* Allow contributors to define their own template functions for other landforms or problem areas
* Make it straightforward to deploy this method in parallel using multiprocessing, [dask](https://dask.readthedocs.io), or other tools

## Features

## Getting started

### Installation

`scarplet` can be installed from PyPI.

```
pip install scarplet
```

### Examples

#### Detecting fault scarps

```python
import numpy as np
import scarplet as sl
from scarplet.WindowedTemplate import Scarp

params = {'scale': 100,
          'age': 10,
          'ang_min': -10 * np.pi / 2,
          'ang_max': 10 * np.pi / 2
         }

data = sl.load('data/faultzone.tif')
res = sl.match(data, Scarp, **params)

sl.plot_results(data, res)
```

#### Extracting confined river channels

```python
import numpy as np
import scarplet as sl
from scarplet.WindowedTemplate import Channel 

params = {'scale': 10,
          'age': 10,
          'ang_min': -np.pi / 2,
          'ang_max': np.pi / 2
         }

data = sl.load('data/channelnetwork.tif')
res = sl.match(data, Channel, **params)

sl.plot_results(data, res)
```
